The ```rapp_platform_launchers``` is a ROS package containing the necessary launchers to deploy RAPP Platform. For now, only the ```rapp_platform_launch.launch``` launcher exists, which deploys the entire RAPP Platform. This can be launched with the following command:

> roslaunch rapp_platform_launchers rapp_platform_launch.launch
